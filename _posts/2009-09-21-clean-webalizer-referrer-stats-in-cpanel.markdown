I find it useful to override some of cPanel's default webalizer configurations. There can be a lot of misleading or unnecessary data when you don't ignore traffic that is being referred to from your own site.

Create the following file:

    
    
    vi /home/username/tmp/webalizer/webalizer.conf
    




    
    
    HideSite *example.com
    HideSite localhost
    HideReferrer example.com/
    MangleAgents 4
    
    TopSites        10
    TopKSites       10
    TopURLs         10
    TopKURLs        50
    TopReferrers    250
    TopAgents       15
    TopCountries    10
    TopEntry        10
    TopExit         10
    TopSearch       20
    TopUsers        20
    
    # Usually you want to hide these
    HideURL         *.gif
    HideURL         *.GIF
    HideURL         *.jpg
    HideURL         *.JPG
    HideURL         *.png
    HideURL         *.PNG
    HideURL         *.bmp
    HideURL         *.BMP
    



Replace **example.com** with the domain you are working on. The next time webalizer runs it will not be clogged with useless referrers generated by your site. To force webalizer to run(in a cPanel environment), execute:


    
    
    /scripts/runweblogs username
