[Ben Orenstein](http://twitter.com/r00k) was kind enough to send me a review copy of his [Vim for Rails Developers](http://www.codeulatescreencasts.com/products/vim-for-rails-developers) screencast. [Vim](http://www.vim.org) is pretty much the only text editor I have used for a few years now and I consider myself a fairly experienced user. This screencast showed me some useful new tips that I have been able to integrate into my daily workflow.

Much of the screencast focuses on the excellent [rails.vim](http://rails.vim.tpope.net/) plugin, primarily using it to move around your project in incredibly efficient ways. He also covers [snipMate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540), [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net), and searching with [ack](http://betterthangrep.com). I found his advice on using ctags quite useful for jumping around the rails source code.

Ben is well spoken and well paced, and I hope to see more screencasts from him(especially ones focusing on vim). _rails.vim_ in particular has much more functionality to offer that I would love to see covered. If you enjoy the visual/audible style of learning be sure to also checkout [vimcasts.org](http://vimcasts.org) for more vim related screencasts.

This screencast probably best for late-beginner to moderately skilled vim users, but even advanced users will probably learn a new technique or two. It might be a bit overwhelming if you are incredibly new to vim as it's focus is on usage and not getting things setup or configured.

Overall I feel if you are looking to get serious with vim the $9 will quickly pay for itself.
