Fellow [ECRuby](http://ecruby.org) group member [Brian Hogan](http://www.bphogan.com/) has released [**Rendera**](http://rendera.heroku.com/), a great web-based tool to learn Haml and Sass markup interactively in your browser. You can paste in your HTML/CSS code and it will convert to Haml and Sass, and vice versa. It also includes a number of interesting [preset examples](http://rendera.heroku.com/#examples) to study - a few exploiting some very cool HTML5 features. Check it out!

(and if you haven't checked out [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) or [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) yet, please do!)
